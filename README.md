This Command Line Applications returns clothes to the user based on the area they are currently in. Referencing weather information via the Darksky API, a user is able to build a 
closet which holds clothes that are appropriate for their location's weather. If the user has already created a closet, they can edit the clothing in their closet or directly ask
"What should I wear today?".
